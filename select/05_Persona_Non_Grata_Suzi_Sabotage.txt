Gather around, pariahs of the night
Join hands and dance in the pale moonlight
Soon they will see our numbers grow
Tonight we'll come out of their shadow

Persona non grata
Persona non grata

Sing with me, pariahs of the night
Chant the anthem of the ostracized
They can no longer silence our cries
Tonight we'll rise and see their demise

Persona non grata
Persona non grata
Persona non grata
Persona non grata
