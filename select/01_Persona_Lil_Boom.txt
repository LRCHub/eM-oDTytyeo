What's wrong? Why not shoot?
Your opponent is just a school boy
Or have you finally realized
The only ones who kill are those who are prepared to be killed?

Ayy, raindrops falling on my head
Feel like I should have been dead
This some shit you can't understand
I erased all my plans to remake 'em again
I wanna drive in that big body Benz
I wanna fuck on that bitch and her friends
Will I get all my goals before my life ends?
I guess it depends

In a Lamb'? In a Ghost? in a drop top hatchback
Smoking on LIFE pack, you don't wanna match that
I'm so antisocial, I don't like contact
Like Maka, me and Death got a contract
When I see you and speak, bitch, you better not lie
I know you faking, I see in your eyes
These niggas Bruce Wayne, they all in disguise
You would've known if you looked through that guide

As I sit on the ground and look up to the sky
I know my life ain't complete so that's why
I gotta go give it all that I have
If you don't make the move
Then you don't make the chance
When I was broke, boy, I ain't have a bed
Back all fucked up 'cause I slept on cement
If Lil Boom can do it, then nigga you can
This to my family and to my fans

Raindrops falling on my head
Feel like I should have been dead
This some shit you can't understand
I erased all my plans to remake 'em again
I wanna go to Japan with my friends
I wanna swerve in that brand new big Benz
Will I get all my goals before my life ends?
It depends

Sometimes there are things that get me down,
They can be hard to deal with,
But I try not to worry about the
Things I can't change, so I just accept them
Remember what you said once?
That you'd rather regret doing something
Stupid than regret doing absolutely nothing?
